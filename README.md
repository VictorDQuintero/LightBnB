# LightBnB Project

This is a simple clone of AirBnb that uses server-side JavaScript to display information from a database into web pages using SQL queries.

I did this project from a skeleton provided by Lighthouse Labs, directly working on the database.js file and the schema, queries and seeds .sql files.
